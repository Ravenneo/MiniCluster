Prerequisites:

    Raspberry Pi Zeros (at least two) with Raspberry Pi OS installed.

    A network switch or router to connect the Raspberry Pi Zeros to the same local network.

    Docker installed on each Raspberry Pi Zero. You can install Docker using the following command on each Pi:


    curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh

Step 1: Initialize Docker Swarm on the Manager Node

Choose one of the Raspberry Pi Zeros to be the manager node. Run the following command to initialize Docker Swarm:

sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER_IP>

Replace <MANAGER_IP> with the IP address of the manager node. This command initializes the Swarm and generates a join token that other nodes will use to join the cluster.

Step 2: Join Worker Nodes to the Swarm

On each Raspberry Pi Zero you want to add as a worker node, run the following command:

sudo docker swarm join --token <TOKEN> <MANAGER_IP>:2377

Replace <TOKEN> with the token generated in Step 1 and <MANAGER_IP> with the IP address of the manager node.
